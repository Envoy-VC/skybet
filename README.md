Skybet offers an engaging and interactive platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to test their predictions and potentially earn rewards.

## User Flow üõ†Ô∏è

#### Contract Deployment and Coin Addition

- The owner of the contract deploys it and gains the ability to add different coins to the platform. This ensures that users have a variety of cryptocurrencies to choose from when creating games.

#### Game Creation

- Once the contract is deployed, any user can create a game by providing the necessary details.
- The user specifies the operator address, which is responsible for managing the game and drawing the result.
- Start and end times for the game are set to determine the duration of the game itself.
- Staking start and end times are defined to establish the period during which users can add or remove their stakes.
- The user also selects the cryptocurrency that will be used for the game.

#### Staking and Voting

- When the game starts, users can add their stakes by depositing the desired amount of the chosen cryptocurrency into the game contract.
- Users also have the opportunity to vote on whether they believe the price of the selected cryptocurrency will go up or down during the staking duration.
- The voting mechanism allows users to express their predictions and participate actively in the game.

#### Stakes Removal

- During the staking period, users have the option to remove their stakes if they change their mind or wish to adjust their strategy.
- This flexibility ensures that users can make informed decisions and adapt to changing market conditions.

#### Waiting for Game End

- After the staking period is over, users must wait until the game ends.
- This waiting period allows sufficient time for the price of the cryptocurrency to be observed and recorded for result determination.

#### Result Determination

- Once the game ends, the operator, who was specified during game creation, draws the result.
- The Phat function, operating behind the scenes, takes the start and end times of the game and retrieves the precise price of the cryptocurrency at those instances, with a precision of up to 8 decimals.
- The result, indicating whether the price went up or down, is then sent back to the contract through a callback function.
- The contract processes the result and updates the game state accordingly.

#### Reward Distribution

- Once the outcome is declared, winning users can claim their rewards.
- The reward distribution is based on the ratio of stakes they have placed relative to other users who have also won.
- This ensures that users are rewarded proportionally to their contributions and successful predictions.

This detailed user flow provides a step-by-step overview of the Skybet app, covering contract deployment, game creation, staking, voting, result determination, and reward distribution.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### üìù Smart Contract

To get started with Skybet smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `phat-contracts` directory and locate the contracts under the `contracts` folder.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Set the required Environment Variables
3. To deploy the contract, you can run the following command
   ```bash
   yarn test-deploy # (for testnet deployment)
    yarn main-deploy # (for mainnet deployment)
   ```
   This will deploy two contracts, one for the game and one for the `$SKY` Token.
4. To run the tests, you can run the following command
   ```bash
    yarn localhost-test
   ```
5. To build the Phat Function run the command
   ```bash
   yarn build-function
   ```
6. To deploy the Phat Function first make sure you have a Bricks profile on [testnet](https://bricks-poc5.phala.network) or [mainnet](https://bricks.phala.network/)

   ```bash
   yarn test-deploy-function # (for testnet deployment)
   yarn main-deploy-function # (for mainnet deployment)
   ```

   Make sure the set the Attester Address in the Skybet Game Contract

7. Additionally, there is already a deployed contract on the Polygon Mumbai and Polygon Mainnet with the contract address:

   ```
   # Token Address
   Mumbai - 0xc7449dC99168ACc5B4701a13F14b85d280bD9811
   Mainnet - 0x853BDA8D4C5d39A27ee6F580C028cacFbf6ebe49

   # Game Address
   Mumbai - 0xB44Ae12e3245A3FbdD9445c536ef568a702e77DF
   Mainnet - 0x640CCEEf4b6d3B46a208EBc44bd20eE70cAAe9A6
   ```

8. And instances of Skybet Phat Functions deployed on the Phala Network Testnet and Mainnet with the contract address:

   ```
   Testnet Po5 - https://bricks-poc5.phala.network/workflows/0x1d75072ca200208088d1c51e69c9f3e3b1ff125e7ff9b716624f10ee38908c76/0
   Mainnet - https://bricks.phala.network/workflows/0xbf840aa11319bddc377ce2b859daa968cb847e4ec53f94e97c33bca57997fcd8/0
   ```

### üì± Skybet Frontend

To get started with the Frontend app, follow these steps:
Navigate to the `app` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a new file called `.env.local` in the root directory of the `app`. This file will contain the required environment variables.
Inside the `.env.local` file, add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=''
```

To obtain the thirdweb Client Id, you can visit the [thirdweb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and retrieve the API key from there.

Once you have filled in the environment variables in the `.env.local` file, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Skybet app.

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and run the Just Roles front-end app on your local development environment.
